# 🔥 Brawlhalla Open API (WIP)
- An unofficial API server with no connection to Brawlhalla and its developers, prepared for easier and unlimited access to Brawlhalla API services. ✅
- It is not designed to defame Brawlhalla and its developers. ❎

# 💢 SelfHost
- The purpose of this repo is that I would like to get easier and more creative ideas from you about developing the repo and getting your ideas. So I can't help much with self-host 🤷‍♂️
